A simple Max/MSP program to edit envelopes to be used esp. with Common Music
or slippery-chicken envelopes (e.g. with emacs). 

You might want to take advantage by its full features by compiling the
project as an application and adding the following lines to your Emacs config
file (e.g. ~.emacs~).

#+begin_src elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c o N")
                '(lambda ()
                   (interactive)
                   (let ((data-lst (replace-regexp-in-string
                                    "['()]"
                                    ""
                                    (sly-last-expression)))
                         (outfile "/tmp/envelope-editor_in.txt"))
                     (message data-lst)
                     (f-write-text data-lst 'utf-8 outfile)
                     (shell-command "open -a envelope-editor")
                     )))
#+end_src

Note: This has been tested on MacOS and requires the envelope-editor.app to be
pesent in your \/Applications directory.
